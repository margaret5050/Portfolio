<h3>How I Got Started</h3>
      <p>
        After I graduated, I was looking for legal jobs. 
         However, every company that I applied to always had a tech vacancy.  During my years at university, I was taught to be commercially aware, one of the topics spoken about was the gap between tech and the legal sector and how to close the gap.<br> I wanted to make myself stand out from the crowd, so I started a journey of computer literacy. I started learning how to use the advanced tools on Microsoft office, especially excel. But I wanted to learn more and since the UK was on lockdown, I used this moment as an opportunity to acquire more skills.<br> On twitter I found out about Code First girls and I enrolled on their web development course.<br> Overall, I was interested in coding because I saw the demand for it.  I want to be on the front lines when tech completely takes over, I mean it involves every facet of our lives.  Of course, I was a little discouraged because I thought coding was for geniuses. But I soon found out, dedication, consistency and a passion to learn and understand programming is all I need to be a great developer.<br>
so, I enrolled myself in the Code First Girls course - web development. It was a basic course. I was taught HTML5, CSS and the basics of JavaScript. However, when I was completing a project with my partner, to differentiate our project from the others we branched out and learned more about CSS, specifically transitions and accordions, JavaScript, specifically animations.  Also, with the help of our instructor we used google maps API to build an interactive map. Currently, I am on a discord learning more about JavaScript e.g. asynchronous programming and the latest JavaScript ES6 and to learn React, js.
